# Logon-s-book-store
a MERN stack book search engine

License

DESCRIPTION
A book search engine app that allows a user to search for new books to read and save books they wish to purchase. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and Google Books API.

This was a refactor of a Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server.
